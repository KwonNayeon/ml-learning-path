# Machine Learning Scientist with Python Certificate Journey

Welcome to my journey towards earning a Machine Learning Scientist with Python certificate from DataCamp! The aim of this certificate journey is to review my knowledge for machine learning. This comprehensive track is designed to equip learners with the essential Python skills and tools needed to land a job as a machine learning scientist.

## Certificate Overview

Through this track, I will gain a comprehensive introduction to machine learning in Python. I will learn how to process data for features, train models, assess performance, and tune parameters for better performance. Additionally, this track covers topics including tree-based machine learning models, cluster analysis, preprocessing for machine learning, and more.

By the time I finish, I will have the confidence to use Python for machine learning, working with real data sets, linear classifiers, gradient boosting, and more. In the process, I will also get an introduction to natural language processing, image processing, and popular Python machine learning packages such as scikit-learn, Spark, and Keras.

## Learning Path

The learning path for the Machine Learning Scientist with Python certificate is divided into several courses and hands-on projects:

- Introduction to Python
- Intermediate Python for Data Science
