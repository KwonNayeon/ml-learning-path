# ML Engineer Cert Journey

This repository documents my journey towards earning a certificate in Machine Learning Engineering from DataCamp. 

## Certificate Overview

The Machine Learning Engineer certificate program is designed to teach fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques, as well as advanced topics such as deep learning, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. By completing this certificate, I will have gained practical experience using industry-standard tools and techniques to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.

## Learning Path

To earn the certificate, I will need to complete a series of courses and hands-on projects, which are organized into the following tracks:

- Fundamentals of Machine Learning with Python
- Supervised Learning with scikit-learn
- Unsupervised Learning in Python
- Deep Learning in Python
- Natural Language Processing in Python
- Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python
- Building Recommendation Engines in Python

I will be updating this repository regularly with my progress, including links to completed projects and any notes or reflections on what I've learned. 

## Feedback

I welcome feedback and suggestions from other learners and industry professionals who are also pursuing a career in machine learning engineering. Please feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have any comments or ideas to share.
