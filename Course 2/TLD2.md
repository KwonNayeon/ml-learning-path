# Today I Learned

## May 1, 2023
 - Git
   - I fixed an error when committing and pushing on Git operations, which took several hours.
   - Initially, I had no idea what was wrong with my code but gradually figured it out.
   - I realized that my personal access token on GitHub had expired after a month, which prevented me from accessing my repository.
   - When trying to commit and push several times, I accidentally overwrote some files, thinking I could fix the error using a different branch.
   - Finally, after fixing the overwritten problem, I was able to successfully commit and push my changes.
