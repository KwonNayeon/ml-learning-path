# Today I Learned

## May 1, 2023
 - Git
   - I fixed an error when committing and pushing on Git operations, which took several hours.
   - Initially, I had no idea what was wrong with my code but gradually figured it out.
   - I realized that my personal access token on GitHub had expired after a month, which prevented me from accessing my repository.
   - When trying to commit and push several times, I accidentally overwrote some files, thinking I could fix the error using a different branch.
   - Finally, after fixing the overwritten problem, I was able to successfully commit and push my changes.

 - So far, I just copied and pasted what I learned through DataCamp courses (I know I was lazy). I didn't import and pre-process data. But, I noticed that those are crucial steps to let others know how my code works. I didn't figure out which steps are needed to pre-process to make my code works. I'll take a look into the data and fix this issue soon.
