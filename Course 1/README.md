# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

This folder contains code and resources for learning about supervised machine learning techniques using scikit-learn in Python.

## Contents

The folder contains the following files and directories:

- `classification_models.py`: A Python script that demonstrates how to train and evaluate several classification models on a dataset of customer reviews.
- `regression_models.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through an example of using linear regression and decision trees for predicting the prices of houses based on various features.
- `datasets/`: A directory that contains sample datasets used in the code examples.
- `README.md`: A Markdown file that provides an overview of the contents of this folder.

## classification_models.py

`classification_models.py` is a Python script that demonstrates how to train and evaluate several classification models on a dataset of customer reviews. The script uses the `scikit-learn` library to perform the analysis and includes examples of models such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.

## regression_models.ipynb

`regression_models.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that walks through an example of using linear regression and decision trees for predicting the prices of houses based on various features. The notebook uses the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

## datasets/

The `datasets/` directory contains sample datasets used in the code examples. The datasets include:

- `telecom_churn_clean.csv`: A dataset used in the classification models example.
- `advertising_and_sales_clean.csv`: A dataset used in the regression models example.
- `diabetes_clean.csv`: 
- `music_clean.csv`: 

## README.md

`README.md` is the file you're currently reading! It provides an overview of the contents of this folder and how to use the code and resources provided here.
