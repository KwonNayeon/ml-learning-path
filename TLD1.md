# Today I Learned

## March 21, 2023

- Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
  - Learned how to build a KNN model to make predictions and how to access the model's accuracy
  - Clarified the concepts of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning
  - Discovered an effective way to see the change of accuracy according to the number of neighbors by using a for loop

- Git
  - I was supposed to take a lesson regarding regression.
  - Instead, today I learned how to use Git to manage version control for my code projects.
  - It took some time and effort, but I successfully connected Git and GitHub, and also integrated Git with my Jupyter Notebook workflow.
  - I am writing this on Jupyter notebook, and it will be automatically in my GitHub page. Amazing!
